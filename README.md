# numpuk3

This app is based on `electron` and `create-react-app`.

## Startup:

1. Run `yarn`
2. Run `yarn start`
3. Run `yarn electron-start`

## Packages:

- `electron` - as many devs were [mistaking](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/npm-install-electron "Electron blog") `electron` for `electron-prebuilt`, the Electron team has joined them together (Electron is a JavaScript runtime that bundles Node.js and Chromium and this module helps you easily install the `electron` command for use on the command line without having to compile anything)
- `foreman` - it is used to run two processes in the same time - the React Webpack server and Electron
