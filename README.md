## Packages:

- `electron` - as many devs were [mistaking](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/npm-install-electron "Electron blog") `electron` for `electron-prebuilt`, the Electron team has joined them together (Electron is a JavaScript runtime that bundles Node.js and Chromium and this module helps you easily install the `electron` command for use on the command line without having to compile anything)

## Resources:
